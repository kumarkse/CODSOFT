This Github repository contains 3 task provided by the codsoft for internship.
1) IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION :
   AIM : Classify iris plants into three species from the iris dataset containing 4 features.
   DATASET : The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician.
             The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor).
             Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

2) TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION :
   AIM : Create a model to Predict whether a passenger on titanic survived or not on the basis of different features. 
   DATASET : Titanic dataset contains 12 variables with 891 entries which are used for training a logistic regression model to predict whether a passenger
             would have survived or not. it contains 11 features & 1 survived target i.e. PassengerId,Pclass,Name,Sex,Age,SibSp,Parch,Ticket,Fare,Cabin,Embarked.
   
4) SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON :
   AIM : Build a model which predicts sales based on the money spent on different platforms for marketing.
         Use the advertising dataset given in ISLR and analyse the relationship between 'TV advertising' and 'sales' using a simple linear regression model.
   DATASET:  Advertising dataset contains 3 variables with 200 entries which are used for training a linear regression model to predict the amount of sales through
             the given amount of advertising expense. it contains features as advertising expense of TV , NEWSPAPER & RADIO.
